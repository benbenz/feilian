  Please read the following HTML code, and then return a **single** Xpath that can recognize the element in the HTML to extract `target value`. 

  Here're some hints:
  1. Do not output the xpath with exact value or element appears in the HTML.
  2. Do not output the xpath that indicate multi node with different value. It would be appreciate to use more @class to identify different node that may share the same xpath expression.
  3. Reference to the `target value` and the generated the xpath to get more context.
  4. When using text predication , always using `contains(., 'value')` instead of `text()='value'`.
  5. If the target xpath ends with `text()[n]`, where n is not 1, please do not ignore it.
  6. If hint text exist, using hint text and hint xpath to compose a new xpath might be a better idea.
  7. If multiple same meaning values are target value, select the most significant one.

  ### Context

  {% for snippet in snippets %}
  #### HTML Fragment {{ loop.index }}:
  ```html
  {{ snippet.html }}
  ```
  {% if snippet['hint_text'] %}
  hint text: `{{ snippet.hint_text }}`
  hint text xpath (Auto generated, DO NOT COPY):
    {%- for xpath in snippet.hint_xpath %}
    {{ loop.index }}. {{ xpath }}
    {%- endfor %}
  {%- endif %}
  target value (JSON encoded): `{{ snippet.target_text }}`
  target xpath (Auto generated, DO NOT COPY THIS):
    {%- for xpath in snippet.target_xpath %}
    {{ loop.index }}. {{ xpath }}
    {%- endfor %}
  {%- endfor %}

  Please answer in the following Json format:
  {
    "thought": "", # a brief thought of how to confirm the value and generate the xpath
    "xpath": "" # a workable xpath to extract the value in the HTML
  }
