  abstract = {HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) has experienced a major transformation during the last decade prior to releasing its latest version known as HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language 5). Several elements conceived around HTML during this period introduced significant problems in the development of the standard due to an increasing fragmentation and complexity in protocols, platforms, devices and systems. With the setting up of the WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) and the popularization of HTML5, initial disagreements between W3C (World Wide Consortium) and other digital platforms around the strategy to follow were put to an end. However, the development of HTML5 has opened up doors to profound changes in the way that web standards are produced and the role of the Web as a techno-social platform. For shedding some light on these issues, this paper provides a retrospective throughout a historical revision of the evolution of HTML, shedding some light into the technical, economic and social factors that helped to create a “Living Standard”. For achieving this objective, the paper is built on the empirical evidence gathered from 21 interviews carried out with different HTML5 experts as well as a documentation analysis around the hypertext standard. This contribution stresses how the platform economy paradigm emerged thanks to different factors contributing to the increasing centralization that can be observed nowadays. Lastly, it is argued that the role of organizations like W3C and others should be strengthened for avoiding the oligopolistic practices of digital platforms in future episodes of socio-technical controversies.}

abstract = {We address the problem of synthesizing a robust data-extractor from a family of websites that contain the same kind of information. This problem is common when trying to aggregate information from many web sites, for example, when extracting information for a price-comparison site.Given a set of example annotated web pages from multiple sites in a family, our goal is to synthesize a robust data extractor that performs well on all sites in the family (not only on the provided example pages). The main challenge is the need to trade off precision for generality and robustness. Our key contribution is the introduction of forgiving extractors that dynamically adjust their precision to handle structural changes, without sacrificing precision on the training set.Our approach uses decision tree learning to create a generalized extractor and converts it into a forgiving extractor, inthe form of an XPath query. The forgiving extractor captures a series of pruned decision trees with monotonically decreasing precision, and monotonically increasing recall, and dynamically adjusts precision to guarantee sufficient recall. We have implemented our approach in a tool called TREEX and applied it to synthesize extractors for real-world large scale web sites. We evaluate the robustness and generality of the forgiving extractors by evaluating their precision and recall on: (i) different pages from sites in the training set (ii) pages from different versions of sites in the training set (iii) pages from different (unseen) sites. We compare the results of our synthesized extractor to those of classifier-based extractors, and pattern-based extractors, and show that TREEX significantly improves extraction accuracy.},

This shift calls into question the optimal technique, as language-only models fail without textual cues while new multimodal models like GPT-4 promise image understanding abilities. We conduct the first rigorous comparison between text-based and vision-based models for extracting event metadata harvested from comic convention websites. Surprisingly, our results between GPT-4 Vision and GPT-4 Text uncover a significant accuracy advantage for vision-based methods in an applies-to-apples setting, indicating that vision models may be outpacing language-alone techniques in the task of information extraction from websites. We release our dataset and provide a qualitative analysis to guide further research in multi-modal models for web information extraction.",
